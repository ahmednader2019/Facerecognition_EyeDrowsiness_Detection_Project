#Facerecognition_EyeDrowsiness_Detection_Project

"This was a vital component of my graduation project, for which I assumed responsibility. The project's objective was to capture a person's face, determine their name (achieved by training the model using a substantial dataset of the person's images), and assess their current state, particularly whether they are awake or asleep, through eye tracking."
